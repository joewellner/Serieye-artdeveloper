      <h3>Atelier Tison</h3>
      <p>
        With a sensitive, technical approach and a pursuit of perfection, Victor Tison approaches sculpture as an aesthete. His work goes beyond pure form, revealing a fascination with the material itself—from modeling to making, from shaping to polishing—a formal, sensual pleasure.
        <br><br>
        The elegance of his pieces reflects a mastery that embraces complexity and expresses a sense of serenity. Beauty becomes ornamental. In a subtle harmony—liquid in appearance, undulating, almost floating—polished brass converses with light.
        <br><br>
        As a mirror of its environment, marked by its space and time, it embodies the forces at work within a reality in constant transformation.

        <h3>Caroline Keslassy</h3>
        <p>
          (b. 1989) is an artist, designer, and interior architect. Her journey began in Paris and
          extended to Silicon Valley, where she developed a unique approach at the crossroads of
          architecture, art, and design, with experimentation as her creative driving force.
          <br><br>
          A graduate in Architecture and Design from the Academy of Art University in San Francisco,
          she founded her interior design studio in Paris in 2016.
          <br><br>
          In 2024, she launched Studio Ki—a platform where art, design, and craftsmanship converge
          through a multidisciplinary approach. Each work, whether an object or a space, engages a
          sculptural and narrative exploration, pushing the boundaries of material, with innovation
          serving both gesture and craft.

      <h3>Lorene Cavagna</h3>
      <br>
        Lorene is a ceramic artist who explores movement and repetition through in-depth research on glazes.
        She is also deeply fascinated by the interaction between light, color, and folds, and has developed a
        technique that reveals the full subtlety of clay—making it extremely fine, almost sharp without compromising
        its structural integrity.
    <br><br>
        Her artistic explorations lie at the intersection of volume and curve, as she sculpts and shapes stoneware—
        a material she particularly appreciates for its resistance to deformation and its surprising delicacy.

                <h3>Sebastien Gafari</h3>
                <p>
                    Coming from a background in applied arts and design research, Sebastien Gafari graduated from the Bordeaux School of Architecture in 2013. Rather than choosing between applied arts and architecture, he embraced both fields to offer a transversal perspective in his projects.
                    <br><br>
                    His focus lies in the narrative quality of spaces and the evocation of emotions tied to both visible and imagined heritage. Deeply passionate about creating perfumes—both for the body and for ambient spaces—he develops a unique olfactory identity for each of his projects. 
                    <br><br>
                    These scents act as a medium, reflecting construction processes and conceptual intentions. Perfuming a space becomes a new way of experiencing it—taming it, and ultimately, loving it.

      <h3>Sten Studio</h3>
      <p>
        Nestled at the seat of one of the world’s richest stone deposits, Sten Studio is a world within a world. Based in Mexico City, Sten Studio is a design laboratory that tackles the beauty and mystery of natural phenomena through the use of stones and crystals in contemporary furniture and bespoke decorative objects.
      <br><br>
        Exploring anything and everything formed by natural processes, the lab embraces minerals as both medium and muse. Driven by the power of collaboration, the design laboratory works both locally and abroad to source some of the most complex and diverse mineral structures known to our natural world.
      <br><br>
        From there, each phase of the design is a shared process across suppliers, fabricators, and manufacturers to develop their ideas in form and concept.

                <p>
                    <strong>BIOGRAPHY</strong><br>
Alex Joncas is a designer and artist whose path led from visual arts to welding and metalwork. In 2016, he co-founded the lighting studio Darmes with Gildas Le Bars. Their creations, made in Quebec, are shown internationally.<br><br>

Joncas creates vases, lighting, and sculptural objects through an intuitive and experimental process. His work explores the transformation of raw materials—wood, metal, glass—marked by fire, heat, and human gesture.<br><br>

Inspired by the Canadian landscape, especially the forest, his pieces blur the line between function and poetry, revealing the tension between resilience and fragility in both nature and material.

                <p>
                    In my works I explore the subjects of freedom of speech, self-restriction and restriction imposed by the state. My research spans across the themes of need of self-defining and self-expression through hiding identity via the street art.<br><br>
                      
                    I've never practiced street art myself, however it has always been a tool of visual archeology—prosopography in the reality that surrounds me. I have always considered this type of art as an encrypted message of urban life, where my personal stories as well as events happening in society can be hidden.<br><br>
                      
                    I explore logocentrism in street art, as well as the integration of non-artistic inscriptions left by ordinary people in street art objects, and the formation of a phenomenon like communication through texts on urban walls and beyond, where anyone can comment on the comments left behind. Based on this research, I fill the space of the created objects with images and words that create an informational and semantic field.
