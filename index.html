                            Carefully selected with my eye for their uniqueness, strength, and beauty, also evaluating their potential over time—not speculatively, but with enlightened boldness, as if I were acquiring them for my own personal living space.

                            Because a work tells the story of its creator, it generates an experience and weaves a deeply human network between people: artists, clients, and friends meet in a qualitative way, forging a precious bond that goes beyond mere transactions.

                            A complete experience must also nourish the senses. Gastronomy holds a central place in the SeriEYE universe, with creative and generous menus imagined by Chef Nicolas Zanel—or by local chefs who design culinary experiences inspired by the exhibited works.
