                        SeriEYE is a contemporary art and design gallery unlike any other. At the crossroads of a gallery, an experiential space, a lifestyle hub, and a celebration of gastronomy.

                        A nomadic contemporary art and design gallery with no fixed walls, it travels the world.
                        Across the globe, it inhabits unique spaces that reflect its identity. SeriEYE brings together collectors and artists in immersive evenings, events, and dinners that highlight gastronomy — featuring the creative and generous cuisine of Chef Nicolas Zanel.

                            SeriEYE showcases only artworks, furniture, and objects selected with both intuition and discernment.
                            Each piece is carefully chosen through my eye for its uniqueness, strength, and beauty — and also for its long-term potential, not in a speculative sense, but with enlightened boldness, as if I were acquiring it for my own home.

                            Yes, SeriEYE could be seen as an “idealized home,” because it brings together everything that matters deeply to me: art, design, meaningful encounters, and the joy of sharing a table.

                             My life journey as a globetrotter in the service of beauty, fashion, lifestyle, and later art, has allowed me to sharpen this Eye — a compass in the fog — spotting emerging creators ahead of time, making choices with discernment, instinct, and conviction, both for myself and those around me, in a deeply human way.
                             Intuitively, I have built a true global network of people who share my philosophy."

                            Because a complete experience must also be flavorful, gastronomy plays a central role — with the creative and generous cuisine of Chef Nicolas Zanel and/or local chefs who craft culinary experiences inspired by the artworks on display, offering guests the chance to quite literally taste the art.
